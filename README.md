# Coin Gecko API Client for Deno

## Overview

API client library for Deno that allows you to work with the [Coin Gecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation). I will be providing implementation for all the official routes listed. Yet, I have no plans to add tests because I do not own the API, nor provide Typescript typings for the data objects returned from the API. For the latter I might actually do it, if I end up using this library on a constant basis.

## Dependencies

Currently none, and I strive to keep it this way.
